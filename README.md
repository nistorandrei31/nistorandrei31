- ⚡ Fun fact: I started learning Linux because my philosophy teacher was using ubuntu and his laptop was very slow.
- I was in 12th grade and there was the corona virus lockdown at out school and we were continuing lessons online and our philosophy teacher was using ubuntu and his laptop was bloated and slow with all kinds of apps and me and my friends we were laughing that his laptop might catch fire and he didn't even had money to buy windows.
- There was the online meme about old people installing ubuntu accidentally and coudn't use their computer anymore. So we were laughing pretty hard. I was the only one of my friends who was curious about the unknown ubuntu operating system and i started learning that ubuntu is based on linux + gnu and it was a free and opensource project.
